# Learning Journal: Exercise 2.1 - Getting Started with Django

## What I Learned

- **Introduction to Django Framework**  
  I learned that Django is a popular Python web framework designed for rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It is a batteries-included framework, providing built-in support for admin interfaces, authentication, ORM, and security features.

- **Web Application Frameworks Overview**  
  I understood how web frameworks like Django and JavaScript frameworks such as React and Angular simplify complex web app development by providing reusable structures and handling common tasks like database access, session management, and templating.

- **Model View Template (MVT) Architecture**  
  Django is based on the MVT architecture, a variation of the traditional MVC pattern.  
  - *Model:* Handles data and database interactions.  
  - *View:* Manages business logic and serves as an interface between Model and Template.  
  - *Template:* Responsible for the user interface and presentation.  
  This separation keeps applications modular, loosely coupled, and easier to maintain.

- **Comparison of MVT and MVC**  
  I learned that unlike MVC where the developer writes controller code, Django’s Template component takes care of this automatically. MVT enables faster development with less boilerplate code and suits projects of all sizes.

- **Benefits and Drawbacks of Django**  
  Django offers fast development, scalability, security, and a strong community but enforces strict project structures that might be limiting for some developers. It’s excellent for large-scale, database-driven web applications but may be too heavy for simple apps.

- **Preparing the Development Environment**  
  I prepared my system by installing Python 3.8.7 (or later), setting up virtual environments using `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper`, and installing Django within the isolated environment. This ensures clean dependency management and project isolation.

- **Installing and Verifying Django**  
  I installed Django via pip inside my virtual environment and verified the installation by checking the Django version with `django-admin --version`.

## Summary

This exercise laid the foundation for Django development by introducing its architecture, benefits, and setup process. I now understand why Django is widely used for scalable and secure web applications and how its MVT pattern differs from MVC. Setting up a dedicated virtual environment and installing Django has prepared me for hands-on project development in the upcoming exercises.
