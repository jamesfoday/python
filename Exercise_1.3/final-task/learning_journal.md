# Learning Journal — Exercise 1.3 Practice Task 3: Loops

During this exercise, I learned how to use loops in Python to replace repetitive code and make programs more efficient and maintainable.

## Key Takeaways:

- **For loops:**  
  I practiced using the `for` loop to iterate over a range of numbers, specifying start, stop, and step values. This allowed me to print a sequence of numbers without writing multiple print statements manually.

- **While loops:**  
  I practiced writing a `while` loop to repeat a block of code as long as a condition remains true. I learned the importance of incrementing variables inside the loop to avoid infinite loops.

- **Advantages of loops:**  
  Using loops simplifies the code, reduces errors, and makes it easier to scale tasks (e.g., printing many numbers or processing lists).

- **Practical implementation:**  
  I rewrote a series of print statements that output multiples of 10 between 10 and 50 using both `for` and `while` loops, and observed the outputs.

- **Understanding control flow:**  
  The exercise reinforced my understanding of Python’s control flow and the importance of indentation and loop boundaries.

## Next steps:

I feel confident about using loops for simple iterations and will build on this knowledge by exploring nested loops, loop control statements (`break`, `continue`), and list comprehensions.
