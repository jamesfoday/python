# Learning Journal â€“ Exercise 1.2 Final Task

## What I Learned

In this task, I deepened my understanding of Python data structures, specifically dictionaries and lists. I learned how to organize complex data using dictionaries with key-value pairs, making the data clear and accessible. I also used lists to hold collections of these dictionaries, allowing me to manage multiple recipes in an ordered sequence. Through this exercise, I practiced creating nested data structures and accessing nested elements, which are essential skills for building real-world applications.

## Challenges Faced

Initially, deciding which data structures to use was challenging. I had to consider mutability, ease of access, and future modifications. Understanding the difference between tuples, lists, and dictionaries helped clarify why dictionaries are best for storing labeled data like recipes.

## Goals for the Future

Moving forward, I want to explore more about how to manipulate nested data structures effectively and practice integrating these with file input/output operations. Additionally, I aim to strengthen my skills in writing clean, modular code and documenting my work clearly to prepare for larger projects.
