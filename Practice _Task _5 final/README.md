# Exercise 1.2 - Data Types and Structures

## Overview
In this exercise, I explored Python data types, including scalar types such as int, float, bool, and NoneType, as well as non-scalar types like tuples, lists, strings, and dictionaries. I practiced manipulating these data structures and learned how to perform arithmetic operations, slicing, indexing, and more.

## Practice Tasks
- **Task 1:** Worked with reading data from a file and performed compound interest calculation using floats.
- **Task 2:** Manipulated tuples by slicing a tuple of world population data and finding the maximum value.
- **Task 3:** Used lists to store and modify a collection of Ford vehicle names, including sorting the list.
- **Task 4:** Practiced string slicing and indexing on sample concatenated strings.
- **Task 5:** Created dictionary structures for recipes, stored multiple recipes in a list, and printed ingredients for each.

## Final Task Justification
For storing each recipe, I chose a dictionary structure because it allows for key-value pairs to represent attributes such as name, cooking time, and ingredients, making it easy to access and modify each attribute by its key. For the collection of multiple recipes, I used a list because it maintains order and allows easy appending or iteration over the recipes.

## How to Run
The Python scripts and IPython commands shown in the screenshots can be executed in a virtual environment with Python 3.8 or above installed.
