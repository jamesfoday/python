# Learning Journal - Exercise 1.1

## What I Learned

- Installed Python 3.8.7 and set up a virtual environment named `cf-python-base`.
- Created my first Python script `add.py` that adds two numbers input by the user.
- Learned how to activate virtual environments and manage packages using `pip`.
- Installed and explored IPython, an enhanced interactive Python shell.
- Created and organized project files inside a dedicated folder `Exercise_1.1`.
- Used Git and GitHub to commit and push my project files.

## Challenges Faced

- Initially confused about managing multiple Python versions, but learned how to install and use virtual environments to handle this.
- Setting up the virtual environment and activating it took some trial and error.
- Understanding how to structure folders and files in the project for best organization.

## Goals and Next Steps

- Get comfortable with writing more complex Python scripts.
- Learn how to use Python frameworks like Django for web development.
- Improve my knowledge of version control with Git and GitHub.
- Practice debugging and testing Python code.
- Build a full web application by the end of this course.
